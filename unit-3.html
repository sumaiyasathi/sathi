            <img src="assets/ad-process.jpg" alt="Advertisement development process" class="unit-3-process-work-img">
            <p>The development process began with market research and competitive analysis to identify effective strategies in similar advertising campaigns. I created mood boards to explore visual directions and sketched multiple concepts before selecting the most promising approach.</p>
            <p>Typography selection was critical to establish the appropriate tone, while color psychology guided my palette choices to evoke specific emotional responses from the target audience.</p>

            <h2>FINAL ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
            <img src="assets/final-ad.jpg" alt="Final advertisement design" class="unit-3-prototype-img">
            <p>The final advertisement successfully combines eye-catching visuals with compelling messaging that resonates with the target demographic. Strategic use of negative space directs attention to key elements, while the carefully crafted call-to-action encourages immediate consumer response.</p>
            <p>This project taught me to balance artistic expression with marketing objectives, creating designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and commercially effective.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION AND LEARNING</h2>
            <p>Through this advertising project, I gained valuable insights into the commercial application of design principles. I learned that effective advertisements must not only look appealing but also communicate clear benefits and motivate specific actions from viewers. This experience developed my ability to approach design challenges from both creative and strategic perspectives.</p>
