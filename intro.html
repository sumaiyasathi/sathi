            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
                When I first walked into this course, I didn't expect to enjoy it—let alone fall in love with it. My original major was Computer Science, and while it sounded like the right path, I didn't feel like me. Something was missing. That's when I made the shift to Graphic Design—a decision that brought me closer to the creative spark I've had since middle school, when I first fell in love with drawing and art.

                Still, at the beginning of this course, I wasn't sure what to expect. But little by little, that started to change. What felt like assignments began to feel like passion projects. With every new tool I learned—GIMP, Photoshop, Figma, and Adobe Illustrator—I saw my skills grow and my creativity expand. Thanks to Ms. Hima's unique and genuinely fun way of teaching, I started to look forward to each task. Her support and encouragement made it easier to push myself and take pride in my progress.

                This portfolio is a reflection of that journey. Each piece—whether it's a bold poster, a heartfelt lyric design, a short film cover, or a product ad—represents a piece of my growth. These aren't just visuals. They are proof that I found joy in creating again. That I started to see my work not as homework, but as artwork.
            </p>

                This is where I found myself again—through design, through storytelling, and through doing what I love.
