            <h3>DIGITAL STORYTELLING & CINEMATOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we explored the art of digital storytelling through film, learning essential cinematography techniques, narrative structure, and video editing principles. We developed a short film from concept to final cut.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a compelling narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end</li>
                <li>Applied cinematography techniques including framing, composition, and camera movement</li>
                <li>Developed skills in lighting, sound recording, and production planning</li>
                <li>Mastered video editing software to create a cohesive final product</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>PROCESS WORK</h2>
            <img src="assets/storyboard.jpg" alt="Storyboard for short film" class="unit-2-process-work-img">
            <p>The development of our short film began with extensive pre-production planning. We created detailed storyboards to map out each shot, developed character profiles, and wrote a script that conveyed our intended message. Location scouting and equipment testing were crucial steps in ensuring smooth production.</p>
            <p>During production, we implemented the rule of thirds for dynamic compositions, experimented with various shot types from close-ups to wide angles, and utilized both natural and artificial lighting to create mood and atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>FINAL FILM</h2>
            <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 20px 0;">

            </div>
            <p>The final film demonstrates our application of digital storytelling principles and technical skills. We carefully selected music and sound effects to enhance the emotional impact, color-graded the footage to establish a consistent visual tone, and paced the editing to maintain viewer engagement throughout.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION AND LEARNING</h2>
            <p>This project taught us the importance of thorough planning and teamwork in film production. We learned to overcome technical challenges, adapt to changing conditions, and make creative decisions that served the story. These skills are directly applicable to professional media production environments.</p>
